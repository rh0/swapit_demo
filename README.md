#SwapIt Demonstration

This module is a simple demonstration of how to build a custom module utilizing the [nodeJS integration module](http://drupal.org/project/nodejs).  For more information on how this module works check out [_Module Development with Drupal and NodeJS_](http://theoleschool.com/blog/module-development-nodejs-integration).  The example code in the post is taken directly from this module.

##Setup

1.  Install and enable the [nodejs integration module](http://drupal.org/project/nodejs) along with the appropriate node server
    configuration.
2.  Enable the swapit demonstration module.
3.  Make sure your node server is running.
4.  Go to mysite.com/swap and check it out!  Use a couple of sessions 
    to see the node-ey goodness.
